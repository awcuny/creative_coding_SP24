# Week 12: Sound

We are meeting over Slack this week.

### Lecture
This week, our focus shifts to audio! We'll cover the fundamentals of sound mechanics, explore various audio visualizers employing [Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform), and check out some projects that leverage audio samples and frequencies to craft engaging interactive music experiences. We will then implement these concepts using [the p5 sound library](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound), which comes standard with p5.

### In Class
1. We will review the homework you did - Final project ideas
2. You will read through the [p5 sound library documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound) to try out audio and p5js.
3. Review the lecture pdf and video above.

### Homework 

1. Our next class is an in-class work session and our group slack conversation will be used as feedback on your progress and questions around your code. Use your time wisely!
