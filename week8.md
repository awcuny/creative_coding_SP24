# Week 08: Kinetic Forms

We are meeting over Slack this week.

### Lecture
This week, we'll delve into [Rune Madsen's blog post](http://runemadsen.com/blog/on-meta-design-and-algorithmic-design-systems/) about the evolving role of designers, where they are increasingly becoming "Meta-Designers." Following our discussion, we'll embark on our journey from static design to motion graphics. Beginning with a concise overview of the history of motion graphics and animation, spanning from thaumatropes to computer animation, we'll then examine several "code in motion" projects. Lastly, we'll explore techniques for animating shapes using p5js.

### In Class
1. We will review the p5 font homework you did last week - be ready to share!
2. Please design an abstract clock with hours, minutes and seconds using p5js.

### Homework 

1. Suggested Reading: pages 173 – 178 and 245 – 249 in Processing by Casey Reas and Ben Fry.
2. Choose one of your static designs from the last 7 weeks and use the draw loop to add some motion to it.
3. Post your sketch to the Slack channel before our next class.
4. Go through the lecture slides for [Week 9](https://teaching-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/creativecoding/lectures/creativecoding_week09.pdf) and watch [the video](https://youtu.be/IKFoGM6bau8?si=wn2E-91MPKuwPMMz). Come to class next week with any questions about mouse interactions and creating brushes.
